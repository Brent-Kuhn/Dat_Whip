This repo was created for the Spring semester class Autonomous Robotics Systems for the team Dem Boyz and Dat Gurl to work as a git repo for the car Dat Whip.

For competative reasons, this repo was private, however, now that the class is over I have moved it to public.

Since time was short, and shenanigans were plentiful, the commit history is sloppy and full of tomfoolery.  Please allow the performance of the car outshine the mess that shall now be called the commit history!
